# Welcome to My Sqlite
***

## Task
Create a Ruby class called MySqliteRequest in my_sqlite_request.rb to mimic the behavior of a request in SQLite. Additionally, develop a Command Line Interface (CLI) program called my_sqlite_cli.rb to interact with the MySqliteRequest class using readline.

## Description
The MySqliteRequest class will allow users to perform SQL-like operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on CSV files, acting as a simplified version of SQLite. The CLI program will provide a user-friendly interface for executing these operations via command-line input.

## Installation
To use the MySqliteRequest class and CLI program:

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Ensure Ruby is installed on your system.
3. Place my_sqlite_request.rb and my_sqlite_cli.rb in the same directory.

## Usage
`MySqliteRequest` Class
Create an instance of MySqliteRequest and chain methods to build a request.
Execute the request by calling the run method.

`my_sqlite_cli.rb` CLI Program
Run the program with `ruby my_sqlite_cli.rb <database_file>`.

Follow the prompts to enter SQL-like commands and interact with the database.
Use commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, FROM, WHERE, and JOIN (with max 1 condition for each).
